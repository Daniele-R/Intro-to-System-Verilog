## Abstract
### Slot Machine Implementation Using Nexys A7

For our final project, Rafael and I are developing a slot machine simulation using the Nexys A7 board. The project will integrate multiple communication protocols and hardware components covered in class, showcasing the practical application of these systems in an interactive and entertaining setup.

The slot machine will feature a variety of input methods to trigger the rolling mechanism. Users can activate it through a keyboard spacebar, a mouse click, or hand detection via the Pmod ToF sensor, illustrating the flexibility of input protocols. The machine's output will include visuals displayed on a VGA interface, showing three numbers or images. A matching sequence will signal a win, accompanied by an auditory cue to enhance user feedback.

To add an extra layer of complexity, the system will respond to temperature changes detected by the boardâ€™s sensors. If the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, the slot machine's algorithm will adjust, altering the odds or outcomes, thereby demonstrating the integration of environmental data into system behavior.

This project highlights the versatility and capability of the Nexys A7 in managing multiple inputs and outputs while combining visual, audio, and sensory feedback. It also underscores our understanding of system integration and real-time hardware-software interaction, presenting a fun yet challenging implementation.
