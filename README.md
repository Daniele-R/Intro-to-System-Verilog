# ECE 4305 - Digital Design Using Verilog HDL
In this repo I submitted the coursework for my course ECE 4305. For this assignments, we were required to work in groups of two, and my partner was Rafael Hernandez [ https://github.com/RafaelHernandezDeLoa ]

## Notes
- Some labs have multiple versions submitted, as V1 are from Rafael, and V2 are mine. While we worked together, we made this class a challenge to see who was able to finish faster and which approach was better/faster. There's exceptions to this, as some labs are only 1 part (combined code).
- Midterms were done individually.
- Final HDL was done by Rafael, and C was done by me.
