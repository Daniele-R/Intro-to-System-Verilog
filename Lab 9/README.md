## 14.7.2 Spectrum display

A rainbow-like spectrum is shown in the figure below. The spectrum can be generated by varying the intensity of the red, green, and blue inputs of the tricolor LEDs. A rainbow light uses the potentiometer and XADC core as the input to specify the desired color on a tricolor LED. Derive the program and verify its operation.

The x axis shows the voltage value as read by the XADC core, you should display this value on the seven segment display using the LED-MUX core.
